Color Intensity - brightness or dullness

Below the graphic, depicts how to choose the right map design given the type of variables (not data type!).
__Aside, spatially continuous variable VERSUS  a continuous data type.__ A discrete data type can be spatially continuous. 
The Y axis refers to spatial discrete or spatial continuous. Spatially continuous means the data occurs at all locations on the map. Like population within a census tract. 
The X axis refers to the frequency of the data.
