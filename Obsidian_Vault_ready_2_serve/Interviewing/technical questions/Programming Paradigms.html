<h3>Declarative and Imperative Umbrellas</h3>
<p>**Declarative** - focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying all the steps on how to achieve the result. Examples, SQL, regular expressions, functional programming</p>
<p>**Imperative** - describes step by by</p>
<h5>Functional</h5>
<p>- programs constructed by applying and composing functions</p>
<p>- functions are treated like 'just another data type'</p>
<p>- apart of declarative</p>
<p>- Haskell</p>
<h5>Object Oriented</h5>
<p>- based on the idea of objects. An object contain data and methods(functions in an object) that act on data.</p>
<p>- Object are created from classes. The class defines the properties (data) and the behaviors (methods)</p>
<p>- great for code reuse and modularity</p>
<p>- Smalltalk</p>
<h5>Procedural</h5>
<p>- apart of Imperative</p>
