### Declarative and Imperative Umbrellas
**Declarative** - focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying all the steps on how to achieve the result. Examples, SQL, regular expressions, functional programming
**Imperative** - describes step by by 

##### Functional
- programs constructed by applying and composing functions
- functions are treated like 'just another data type' 
- apart of declarative
- Haskell
##### Object Oriented 
- based on the idea of objects. An object contain data and methods(functions in an object) that act on data.
- Object are created from classes. The class defines the properties (data) and the behaviors (methods)
- great for code reuse and modularity 
- Smalltalk
##### Procedural 
- apart of Imperative
