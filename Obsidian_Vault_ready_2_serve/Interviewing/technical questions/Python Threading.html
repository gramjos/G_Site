<p>Broadly speaking, threading allows for different parts of a program to run concurrently.</p>
<p>A thread is a separate flow of execution, meaning two things will happen at "**once**" (not really for most python implementations) they merely appear to happen at once. Getting python to run multiple tasks simultaneously requires a non-standard implementation or using the multi-processing library. The mainstream CPython implementation causes threads to be ineffective is some situations dues to <a href="/notes/interviewing/technical-questions/python-s-gil">Python's GIL</a> that *essentially* limits only one thread to run at once.</p>
<h4>What is a good candidate for threads?</h4>
<p>Tasks that spend time waiting for external resources</p>
<h4>What is **NOT** a good candidate for threads?</h4>
<p>CPU-bound problems. Then use the multi-processing library.</p>

<p>In python a daemon thread is a type of thread that will shut down immediately after the program exits. If a program is running threads that are not daemons then the program will wait for those to finish before terminating the program.</p>
