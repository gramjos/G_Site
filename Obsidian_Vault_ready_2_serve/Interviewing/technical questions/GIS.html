<p>> [!info]- What is a GIS</p>
<p>> High Level: A Geographic Information System is a set of computer tools that allows one to work with data that is tied a particular location on Earth.</p>
<p>> A database with attributes that have a spatial Object tied to each record.</p>
<p>> A GIS includes the tools for creating data, map making and analyzing the relationships</p>
<p>> [!info]- What can a GIS be used to do?</p>
<p>> land use planning, environmental management, sociological analysis, business marketing, city planning.</p>
<p>> "Bartlett Map hub" examples: "Railroad Crossing Complaint Logger" ArcGIS Online map and form.</p>
<p>> [!info]- What are the types of map data?</p>
<p>> **Discrete and Continuous**</p>
<p>> Discrete - finite or countably infinite set of values. Can be categorical or numeric. Example: Student in a class (cant have a half student) and outcomes of rolling a dice, or Land cover options.</p>
<p>> Continuous - Can take any value within a range (real numbers). Examples: Temperature, height and weight</p>
<p>> [!info]- What are Data Formats?</p>
<p>> **Raster and Vector**</p>
<p>> Raster - used a bit map data structure (cells in a grid approach to defining space). Ideal for continuous change across a region like land cove classification</p>
<p>> Vector - uses XY referenced vertices and paths for discrete data ideal for governmental boundaries</p>
<p>> TIN - Triangular Irregular Network, defines a set of adjacent triangles over a space.</p>
<p>> Raster V. Vector:</p>
<p>> - Vector provides more compact storage for discrete objects like for boundaries. Vector data models only store the perimeter of the entity while raster would have to store the area.</p>
<p>> [!info]- What is map scale</p>
<p>> Is the conversion of from a map distance to reality</p>
<p>> [!info]- What is Resolution</p>
<p>> refers to the sampling interval at which data is acquired.</p>
<p>> _spatial resolution_ - the distance interval at which the measurement was taken</p>
<p>> _temporal resolution_ - time interval</p>
<p>> [!info]- What is precision</p>
<p>> number of significant figures</p>
<p>> [!info]- What are shapefile</p>
<p>> developed by ESRI</p>
<p>> vector format</p>
<p>> consists of many files:</p>
<p>> .dbf for stores attributes</p>
<p>>  .sbn for</p>
<p>> .shx stores spatial extent</p>
<p>> .shp stores location geometry</p>
<p>>  .shp.xml for meta data</p>
<p>>  .prj stores coordinate system</p>
<p>> [!info]- What are geodatabases</p>
<p>> types: personal, file and enterprise. Distinguished by storage. Respectively, MS Access file, folder in file system, commercial Relational Database Management System.</p>
<p>> [!info]- What is Geographic Coordinate System?</p>
<p>> Angular measurement from the center of the Earth</p>
<p>> [!info]- What is Map Projection</p>
<p>> transformation of a 3D earth model to 2D map.</p>
<p>> Three major classes: Cylindrical (UTM), Conic (Lambert), Azimuthal (polar)</p>
<p>> [!info]- Geo-Reference V. Geocode</p>
<p>> geocode - given name of location coordinates are returned</p>
<p>> geo-reference - aligns different geo information to a known GCS (through: data shifting, scaling, rotating, rectifying)</p>
<p>> [!info]- Spatial Join</p>
<p>> combining tables based on spatial features by containment or proximity criterion</p>
<p>> [!info]- Overlay</p>
<p>> viewing two feature classes at once</p>
<p>> [!info]- Buffer</p>
<p>> creates new zone around the proximity of a feature</p>
<p>> [!info]- Buffer</p>
<p>> creates new zone around the proximity of a feature</p>
