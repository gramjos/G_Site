<p>Founded in 2014 as a colllab of **American Energy Technology Institute (GTI) & Industry-Funded R&D**. First worked on material traceability the focused on _in-built_ automation with GPS and barcode.</p>
<p>Now a full digital construction solution from planning to build close out.</p>
<p>Qs:</p>
<p>company size</p>
<p>does it feel like a start up?</p>

<p>Interview 2 with Alicia Farag and Isaiah Summers</p>
<p>Alicia Farag: Co-Founder and President. went to Chicago South Side Homewood-Flossmoor Community High School and to U of I for Civil engineering. also holds an MBA in Global Energy from the University of Warwick</p>
<p>_From the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Conference in Austin, TX 2023_</p>
<p>The transition to electrification require the grid to be built out</p>
<p>Alicia Farag says, "the utility companies lack high quality asset traceability"</p>
<p>Pushing for an industry wide standard 'smart IDs' hosted on a decentralized network</p>
<h4>_From the [Grid Mod Pod with with Elizabeth Cook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMjuNLXd8UY)_</h4>
<p>- Not only standardizing ID tag but also the material use to build out the grid.</p>
<p>- ? converting R&D ideas into a real industry? "buy in from the top down (government ) OR bottom up meaning the companies want its pure usefulness" --> hurdles, "just getting the industry together"</p>
<p>- _term_ digital thread - all the data necessary for asset management history managed by the system called  SCATE (Supply Chain and Asset Traceability for Electric). This information mainly from the manufacturer like: all of the rating, mechanical and electrical properties serial number.</p>
<p>- "We want the use cases to define the data model" -Alicia</p>
<p>> [!info]+ Use Cases</p>
<p>> __Mutual Aid__ - request for material from a competitor. Streamline information exchange</p>
<p>> __Recalls and Systemic Performance Issues__ - failures from a certain manufacturing batch then need to know where are the affected assets</p>
<p>> __As-built monitoring__</p>
<p>Similar Examples in other industries: baby food, meztcal</p>
<p>_So its not about convincing companies to buy into the idea, not its about execution and being use case driven_-Graham-ism</p>
<p>###### Why Locusview</p>
<p>- I'm attracted by the tech you use, GIS</p>
<p>- Also I feel i'm align grand vision of creating clarity in the supply chain electric utilities</p>
<p>- As Alicia said in the Edison electric conference a decentralized network of smart ID</p>
<p>- This reminds of the concept of cradle to cradle. which is designing products with the end of life in mind. When end of life comes theres a plan use these "outputs" as inputs to another economic activity.</p>
<p>- The first step is something like the SCATE program</p>
<p>###### Alicia Q's</p>
<p>- I heard you say, "We want the use cases to define the data model" -Alicia Q: What the biggest thing you learned from implementation testing</p>
<p>- Given a product line who are your biggest? Who have you lost business to and why?</p>
<p>- Upon a successful internship is full employment available?</p>
<p>- Say, if you did higher me, after six months time, how would you know you made the right decision?</p>
<p>###### Isiah Q's</p>
<p>- Can describe a typical day?</p>
<p>- what skills would make you better at your job?</p>
<p>- As a potential colleague what skills do you wish i could bring to the table?</p>
<p>- what are your thoughts on pair programming?</p>
