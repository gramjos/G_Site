<p>> [!info]- What do you know about company 'X'?</p>
<p>></p>

<p>></p>
<p>> [!info]+ Describe a database to me like I'm 5 years old?</p>
<p>> A DB is a way to store things(like words and numbers) in an ordered way. Lets say we are Santa Clause and we need to keep track of which present the kids want and whether they have been good or not. So Lets think how we would store this information. We have sheet of paper of all the children in the world. This is a very long sheet of paper and it has one name on each line and above the first name there is label called "Name." Next to word</p>
<p>></p>
<p>> [!info]+  How would you describe the company culture and the management style?</p>
<p>></p>
<p>> [!info]+ What aspect about the company surprises most new hires?</p>
<p>></p>
<p>3 things about yourself:</p>
<p>1. I have an insatiable curiosity that I manage with a note taking system called Obsidian. I call it my second Brian it's where I start the store all the information that I find is valuable. In a world where we are inundated with information. It is so important to know what to keep in your active recall, what to keep in your deep memory, what to put in your notebook and what should be looked up on the spot or just in time information. I take my knowledge management system very seriously.</p>
<p>2. I value human connection. Above all I try to leave situation better than I arrived at at. And this can come in many forms. I know in a business and merriment we usually have strict goals to maximize a certain metric. But when dealing with other colleagues or clients, it is important to remember we all have many things in common, even though we may seem different. We all struggle with the same human condition.</p>
<p>3. I am an innate teacher. I do believe knowledge is power in the truest sense. I enjoy arming people with knowledge they need to achieve their goal goals. It is very fulfilling for me to disperse my knowledge because I know what goes around comes around and I can't wait to learn from everybody else.</p>

<p>Why do you want to work at Red Bull in Information Technology? If you were to make a list of what's important to you in a job/career, what would you write?</p>
<p>I want to work for Redball in information technology because information technology is where my skills lie, and I want to use them at red ball because I see red ball as an intelligent company because of their history of strategic brand/athlete alliances that keep them in the limelighte. Also, I see red bowl as a fun company I wanna be around people who are having fun who have a smile on the face but we're also working hard I know it's cliché to say but I think there's deepo= wisdom and work hard play hard.</p>
<p>in a career, I value growth. Personal growth, professional growth, and economic growth. I want to surround myself with intelligent, hard-working people That push me out of my comfort zone. It is important to me that I'm constantly learning, but not just technical information but learning about new interesting cultures, people and extreme sports.</p>

<p>How do you approach an activity or task that is new to you?</p>
<p>there are many nuances to this question. While, I do believe there are tried and true methods of achieving some goal I value the creative endeavor of seeing a new problem for the first time. Fresh eyes and fresh brains on a problem can bring wonders. New people on new tasks are not entrenched in the old way of doing things, and should allow their creativity to be unhinged. But I would like to couch those previous statements with "sometimes you do not need to reinvent the wheel."</p>
<p>Practically speaking when I approach new task, I will initially have a brainstorming session and jock down my initial thoughts. I'll look to company history or industry history on what has worked before and what is working now. I'll ask myself, Are there any known efficiencies and what tools do I have available? And, I would embrace the process of drafting. I'm OK with crappy first drafts. As long as I know that they are first drafts. And after my first draft I'd seek Who is the subject matter expert. Where can I read their material. The answer usually lies in copious reading.</p>

<p>Tell us about a time where you were working on a team and your team members disagreed on your approach or solution. How did you handle this situation?</p>
<p>I'd like to re-tell a scenario during a group porject I had in my senior Kapstone class. We agreed we wanted to build a Weather application and all mutually decided we wanted to use the language in Python. But what brought disagreement was what framework we should use. We were trying to choose between between flask and Django. A confident vocal member of my group had experience with flask, and was really pushing for it. He even had a project demonstrating Their knowledge. They spoke very persuasively. Most of the group members didn't have a strong opinion, and were willing to learn either framework, but I knew this wasn't the correct decision process just because one person had experience, but not an expert. there were four other people in the group.  I disagreed with this decision making process I knew I wasn't going to choose what technology to learn just because someone had a little experience in one. So I convinced my group on the idea that we should build an extremely simple app in both frameworks and see firsthand the the contrast. In the end we did end up going with the group members preferred choice, but for more logical reasons. We chose a framework for practicality, and not out of the whim of someone's preference.</p>

<p>Tell us about a time when you had to juggle multiple priorities. What was the situation? How did you handle it and what did you learn?</p>
<p>At the beginning of this academic year, I had a very full plate of responsibilities. I chose to be leader of my capstone group, I had a part-time job being a university lab assistant, I had a full load of classes, and I needed to apply for jobs. Also, my tutoring was noticed by a professor, and I was asked to present on certain topics in their class. And I couldn't shy away from this opportunity, so I accepted the increased workload because I knew it was a valuable learning experience. Most importantly, I had to leave time to recharge with my social life and exercise so I can put my best foot forward in this other areas of my life. Overall, I refined my time management skills. Assigned priority to each of the areas I described earlier and I knew each day I had to give X many hours to every task. I embraced routine. I Formalized my routine so each day I didn't have to guess on what to work on. I knew what was important. What was the next big deadline and I could spend my time working. My main Takeaway was that I can't make everything perfect but if I work hard and I can trust in my routine, I know my output is the best that I can offer and that's all I can ask for.</p>
