Founded in 2014 as a colllab of **American Energy Technology Institute (GTI) & Industry-Funded R&D**. First worked on material traceability the focused on _in-built_ automation with GPS and barcode.
Now a full digital construction solution from planning to build close out. 

Qs:
company size
does it feel like a start up?
culture
full time after intern

Interview 2 with Alicia Farag and Isaiah Summers

Alicia Farag: Co-Founder and President. went to Chicago South Side Homewood-Flossmoor Community High School and to U of I for Civil engineering. also holds an MBA in Global Energy from the University of Warwick

_From the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Conference in Austin, TX 2023_
	The transition to electrification require the grid to be built out
	Alicia Farag says, "the utility companies lack high quality asset traceability"
	Pushing for an industry wide standard 'smart IDs' hosted on a decentralized network
 #### _From the [Grid Mod Pod with with Elizabeth Cook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMjuNLXd8UY)_
- Not only standardizing ID tag but also the material use to build out the grid.
	- ? converting R&D ideas into a real industry? "buy in from the top down (government ) OR bottom up meaning the companies want its pure usefulness" --> hurdles, "just getting the industry together"
- _term_ digital thread - all the data necessary for asset management history managed by the system called  SCATE (Supply Chain and Asset Traceability for Electric). This information mainly from the manufacturer like: all of the rating, mechanical and electrical properties serial number.
- "We want the use cases to define the data model" -Alicia

> [!info]+ Use Cases
> __Mutual Aid__ - request for material from a competitor. Streamline information exchange
> __Recalls and Systemic Performance Issues__ - failures from a certain manufacturing batch then need to know where are the affected assets
> __As-built monitoring__ 

Similar Examples in other industries: baby food, meztcal 

_So its not about convincing companies to buy into the idea, not its about execution and being use case driven_-Graham-ism


###### Why Locusview 
- I'm attracted by the tech you use, GIS
- Also I feel i'm align grand vision of creating clarity in the supply chain electric utilities
- As Alicia said in the Edison electric conference a decentralized network of smart ID
- This reminds of the concept of cradle to cradle. which is designing products with the end of life in mind. When end of life comes theres a plan use these "outputs" as inputs to another economic activity.
- The first step is something like the SCATE program

###### Alicia Q's
 - I heard you say, "We want the use cases to define the data model" -Alicia Q: What the biggest thing you learned from implementation testing
- Given a product line who are your biggest? Who have you lost business to and why?
- Upon a successful internship is full employment available?
- Say, if you did higher me, after six months time, how would you know you made the right decision?
###### Isiah Q's
- Can describe a typical day?
- what skills would make you better at your job? 
- As a potential colleague what skills do you wish i could bring to the table?
- what are your thoughts on pair programming?
