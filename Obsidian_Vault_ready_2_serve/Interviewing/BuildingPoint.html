<h5>Why BuildingPoint?</h5>
<p>I'm attracted to your holistic interviewing approach, [quote job description] _We don't hire employees for a specific position in our company. We hire them based on whether they're a good fit with our culture and then begin a six-month fully-paid rotation plan to find a position best suited for their skill set and matching their career goals._</p>
<p>I like small companies. I don't want to get lost in a large bureaucratic structure. I want to make a difference and be accountable for my work.</p>
