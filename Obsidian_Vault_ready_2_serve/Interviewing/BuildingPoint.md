##### Why BuildingPoint?
I'm attracted to your holistic interviewing approach, [quote job description] _We don't hire employees for a specific position in our company. We hire them based on whether they're a good fit with our culture and then begin a six-month fully-paid rotation plan to find a position best suited for their skill set and matching their career goals._
I like small companies. I don't want to get lost in a large bureaucratic structure. I want to make a difference and be accountable for my work.
##### Why this Job -> Rotational Program
