<h2>Builtins Commands Versus Commands located on `PATH`</h2>
<p>_Most_ commands come from a program on the file system. In contrast, some commands, out of necessity need to be baked into the shell's program file (making it a **builtin**) because the command affects the current shell. For this reason and efficiencies (a bloated shell file) commands are either placed in the builtins or on `PATH`</p>
<h4>Shell Builtins</h4>
<p>- These commands do not start separate process.</p>
<p>`$ type pwd`</p>
<p>`pwd is a shell builtin`</p>
<p>Same information can be found by using the `which` command</p>
<h4>File System Commands</h4>
<p>- located on the **PATH** variable</p>
<h4>Builtin example `alias`</h4>
<p>- they are created using shell builtins because `alias` stores an `alias` the currently running shell process, so t must be a builtin</p>
<p>`$ type alias`</p>
<p>`alias is a shell builtin`</p>
