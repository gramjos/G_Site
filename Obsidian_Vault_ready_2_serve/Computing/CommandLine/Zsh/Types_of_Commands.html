<h2>Builtins Commands Versus Commands located on <code class="inline-code">PATH</code></h2>
<p><em>Most</em> commands come from a program on the file system. In contrast, some commands, out of necessity need to be baked into the shell's program file (making it a **builtin**) because the command affects the current shell. For this reason and efficiencies (a bloated shell file) commands are either placed in the builtins or on <code class="inline-code">PATH</code></p>
<h4>Shell Builtins</h4>
<p>- These commands do not start separate process.</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">$ type pwd</code></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">pwd is a shell builtin</code></p>
<p>Same information can be found by using the <code class="inline-code">which</code> command</p>
<h4>File System Commands</h4>
<p>- located on the **PATH** variable</p>
<h4>Builtin example <code class="inline-code">alias</code></h4>
<p>- they are created using shell builtins because <code class="inline-code">alias</code> stores an <code class="inline-code">alias</code> the currently running shell process, so t must be a builtin</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">$ type alias</code></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">alias is a shell builtin</code></p>
