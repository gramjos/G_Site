<h4>Fundamental Data Structure of Machine Learning , __Tensor__</h4>
<p>An image is an arrays of pixels.</p>
<p>Computer images are stored as 2 dimensional arrays, which can be thought a 2D mathematical matrix. A matrix with more than 2 dimensions is the same structure as a __tensor__.</p>
<h4>Batch, many images (as tensors) in one _`&#39;batch tensor&#39;`_</h4>
<p>When working with an image what data structures are we using?</p>

<p>`digital_0_array_og` is a multi dimensional array from the numpy library called `ndarray`  (28, 28, 3) $\text{X,Y,Z}$. Can be read as grid of pixels, where each pixel is represented by 3 values. These three values typically correspond to the color channels Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Therefore, this array structure holds the data for a 28 by 28 pixel color image</p>
