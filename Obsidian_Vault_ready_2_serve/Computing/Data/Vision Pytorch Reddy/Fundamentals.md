__Universal Approximation__ _there is always a largest enough neural network architecture with the right weights that can exactly predict any output given an input_ 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) replace the __Expert System__, which specific rules (tricks) that aid in classification. The amount of rules can be exponential. ANN, mathematically, are a function that take one more tensors as input and output one or more tensors

$$ a = f\left(w_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i\right) $$
Where `n` is the number of inputs.
